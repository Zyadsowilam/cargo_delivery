Cargo Delivery using Data Structures and Algorithms in C++
This project implements a cargo delivery system using various data structures and algorithms in C++. The system is designed to efficiently manage and optimize the delivery of cargo from one location to another.

Features
Cargo Management: The system allows for the management of cargo items, including their identification, weight, destination, and other relevant information. This information is stored and organized using appropriate data structures.

Data Structures: The project employs various data structures, such as graphs, priority queues, hash maps, or other suitable structures, to efficiently store and retrieve cargo and route information. These data structures ensure fast and organized access to the necessary data during the delivery process.

Usage
Install C++ Compiler: Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system. Popular options include GCC, Clang, and Microsoft Visual C++.

Clone the Repository: Clone the project repository from GitHub to your local machine.


Customize the Cargo and Network: Modify the source code to define the cargo items, their properties, and the delivery network. Update the data structures and algorithms to suit your specific requirements.

Run the Application: Execute the compiled executable to run the cargo delivery system. Follow the instructions or interact with the user interface to perform cargo management, route optimization, and delivery simulations.

Analyze Results: Review the system's output and analyze the delivery routes, optimized paths, and other relevant metrics to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of the cargo delivery system.
